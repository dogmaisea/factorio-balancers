# factorio-balancers - 2024 AUGUST

Factorio Balancer Book by Dogmai
- DogmaiSEA || Dogmai - South East Asia (Servers)

A collection of balancers, based mainly on Raynquist's Balancer Books (Fall 2020 and Fall 2022), with quality of life changes to the book and additional balancers, see changelog below.

## The Concept

Not long after I first started playing Factorio I came across Raynquist's Fall 2020 book, however with a new installation of the game, I lost that book and downloaded the Fall 2022 book instead, which was missing balancers I use regularly.

Over time, I created my own balancers that were kept in a separate book, so now I had a total of three balancer books and things were just getting messy and frustrating.

The idea behind this balancer book is to create one blueprint book that has the best of all balancer books, the formatting is based upon Raynquist's Fall 2022 book, however I have made, what I consider, to be quality of life improvements to the book.

This includes removing the word "balancer" from all balancers, as we know they are balancers, as well as having the four most commonly used balancers for the early game on the front page of the book.

I have gone one by one every balancer, and checked the minimum belt requirement, any balancers that could be updated to a lower belt requirement with very minor changes, I have gone ahead and done that, as noted in the changelog below.

I have also included a few of my own balancer designs, such as the 8_8_inline_lane_tu_blue, which I am really proud of.

I hope this book goes on to serve you well.

Credit has been given whenever possible, if I have missed anyone just send me a message on Reddit - u/dogmaisea

## A message to Raynquist

Raynquist, we, the Factorio community, owe you everything.

The never ending kindness, support and patience you have shown to us when teaching us about balancers, compiling your books, taking time out of your busy life to help numerous strangers you will never meet; I can only hope that our gratefulness shines goodwill upon your life.

You don't need my permission to use anything you see here, my balancer designs are yours to do as you see fit, I only hope you are proud of the designs I came up with, as I still honestly have no idea how balancers work, I just simply rearrange things that you have done, it is the way my brain works.

Okay, so I might kind of understand how balancers work a little bit, but I will never be anything compared to you mate, I honestly do not believe I would ever be able to design an amazing balancer from scratch such as you have.

Thank you mate, for everything.

## Changelog

Changelog from Raynquist's Balancer book Fall 2022. Last updated: 2024-08-15 (2024 AUGUST BOOK)

---

Removed the text "_balancer" from all balancers as we know they are balancers; also with the possibilities of being inline, lane, tu and red/blue belt, the names got too long.

All balancers have been rotated 180Â° because the upside-down nature of Raynquist's book was doing my head in.

They now flow top to bottom, left to right, or left to bottom.

Updated the book with Split Balancers and Corner Balancers.
